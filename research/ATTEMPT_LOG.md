## O1C-0000 — Integration-instrument baseline

- **Recorded:** 2026-07-15T12:05:14+02:00
- **Source commit:** `5bb39913bec2712ce1348bc5b9667b6d5798326b`
- **Claim level:** `INSTRUMENT`
- **Hypothesis:** O1 bounded memory, O1-O typed adaptive control and the exact
  recovery backend can share a deterministic, provenance-safe integration seam.
- **Outcome:** Supported at harness level. The lab has deterministic memory and
  evidence baselines, a legal typed chain, a bounded TargetModel, a real O1-O replay
  and a 570-member verified publication source.
- **Controls:** under-capacity CountSketch, full-context ceiling, no-signal stream,
  perfectly correlated stream, post-reveal flow rejection.
- **Cost:** five synthetic seeds; 42 unit tests; no external GPU or active-run work.
- **Limitation:** no real cipher-derived bit evidence has entered the O1 state.
- **Breadcrumb:** Stage 3 is the first unresolved gate; use manifest-pinned
  pre-result artifacts and attacker-computable features before building more memory
  mechanisms.
- **Artifacts:** `runs/quick.json`, `runs/o1o-2026-02-18-replay.json`,
  `runs/fullround-source-verification.json`.
- **Next action:** `O1C-0001` Stage-3 dataset selection and ingestion.
