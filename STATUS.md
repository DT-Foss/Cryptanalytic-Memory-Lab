# O1 Cryptanalytic Memory Lab — Current Status

- **Last updated:** 2026-07-17T02:44:45+02:00 (`Europe/Berlin`)
- **Implementation commit:** `cf7ef298caf80006ae3470240d509c661221b150`
- **Worktree note:** two tested W46 fresh-challenge files and the new O1-256 design
  documents are intentionally uncommitted pending integration with O1C-0008
- **Research phase:** O1-256 Living Inverse — full-width attacker contract and
  contrast-stream foundation
- **Strongest internal mechanism:** O1C-0007's 12-register/266-byte unary state is
  retained as a negative-calibrated primitive; the active design adds proof
  interactions, switching wavelengths and a 20,492-byte full-256 living state
- **Strongest read-only mechanism intake:** A447-A449 proof ancestry, A465 cubic
  Product-of-Experts and A469 positive bucket-local correction
- **Active runs:** none
- **Last completed attempt:** `O1C-0007` — upstream solver-evidence Bit-Vault freeze
- **Next attempt:** `O1C-0008` — full-256 public-output attacker/teacher boundary,
  contrast generator, trace instrumentation and progress-vector baseline
- **Primary uncertainty:** whether any attacker-valid full-round public-output
  contrast channel removes stable entropy from uniform unseen 256-bit keys
- **SOTA status:** no lab SOTA result yet; O1C-0007 passed its protocol and compact-
  state gates but failed scientific efficacy at exact conditional `p=0.593505859375`
- **SOTA target:** a stream-length-bounded living inverse that reduces the 256-bit
  key code length on sealed uniform targets and ultimately emits an exactly verified
  full ChaCha20 key

## Headline

The target contract is now final: every attacked key has 256 unknown bits from the
first experiment.  The deployment path sees only public counter/nonce/output plus
self-generated candidate keys, their outputs and their internally computable
traces.  Target round states, carry paths and proof objects are training labels
only.  Reduced-width residual recovery is not an intermediate target claim.

The 2026-07-17 read-only W52 intake supplied mechanism, not target data.  A447/A448
show that exact proof ancestry transfers where flattened clause provenance does
not.  A460/A462/A463 expose complementary switching wavelengths `64/96/65`; A465
combines them with a cubic Product-of-Experts; A469 shows that interaction evidence
must be positive, bucket-local and identity-preserving.  These become the sensor,
timescale, backbone and correction layers of the Living Inverse.

O1C-0007 remains a useful boundary: a pure unary state is structurally compact but
its selected result has exact conditional `p=0.593505859375`.  The new architecture
therefore includes pair/causal interaction from its first trained arm rather than
repeating the unary decoder on another narrow target.

The full design and exact attacker boundary are in
[`docs/O1_256_LIVING_INVERSE.md`](docs/O1_256_LIVING_INVERSE.md); the measured W52
transfer map is in
[`research/W52_TRANSFER_20260717.md`](research/W52_TRANSFER_20260717.md).

## Highest-ROI next actions

1. `O1C-0008`: implement the 256-bit public-output deployment schema, privileged
   teacher schema, full-round traced ChaCha20 generator and structured/uniform
   contrast stream.
2. Implement the complete metric vector: 256-bit key NLL, predictable bits,
   byte/16-bit rank, million-decoy full-key rank, effective domain compression and
   exact-beam verification.
3. `O1C-0009`: train output-only and candidate-relative 256-bit baselines on CPU,
   with target-trace inputs mechanically impossible.
4. `O1C-0010`: stream contrast evidence through the O1 vault, holographic banks,
   A465 backbone and A469 local correction; attack a sealed uniform 256-bit target.
5. Iterate at full width on round/carry/proof observability and O1-O scheduling;
   short MPS windows require an explicit resource check and must not overlap W52.

## Resume here

Start from `O1C-0008`: build the full-256 attacker/teacher boundary and contrast
generator described in `docs/O1_256_LIVING_INVERSE.md`.  Preserve the tested
uncommitted W46 broker as a side artifact, but do not generate a W46 target.  The
first outcome-bearing target must be uniform random, 256-bit, sealed, full-round and
public-output-only.  Keep the sibling W52 queue read-only and resource-prioritized.
